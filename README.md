# LeetCode
This repo is a place to store my solutions to come back to easily for leetcode as I prepare for Summer 2025's Internship Cycle. My goal is to have completed LeetCode 75 by the August 27th, 2024.

## Organization
I have broken each problem into its own file and grouped the files into three different directories:
- Completed
- Incomplete
- Failed
<br/>

<div style="color: green"><u>Completed</u>: I passed all of the test cases, regardless of runtime / space performance </div><br/>
<div style="color: yellow"><u>Incomplete </u>: I started but didn't finish </div><br/>
<div style="color: red"><u>Failed</u>: I tried and failed. Hopefully this is empty because I should then work through it again to fix it </div>
